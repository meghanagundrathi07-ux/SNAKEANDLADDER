1. Proj Title:-

Snake and Ladders Game in C

A simple terminal-based Snake and Ladders game built using the C programming language.
This project is ideal for beginners and academic submissions.

2. Objective:-

The main objective of this project is to implement a basic Snake and Ladders game using C programming concepts such as:
-Loops
-Conditional statements
-Functions
-Random number generation
Simple game logic (snakes, ladders, and movement rules)
The game allows a single player to roll a dice and move from position 0 to 100, interacting with snakes and ladders on the board.

3. How to Compile and Run the Program

on vs code
compilation-gcc SNAKESANDLADDER.c
execution- ./a

5. Important Notes / Assumptions

-Dice numbers range from 1 to 6.
-Landing on a snake head moves the player down to a lower position.
-Landing on a ladder start moves the player higher.
-The player must reach exactly 100 to win.
-If the dice value exceeds 100, the player stays in the same place.
-Works on all major C compilers (GCC, MinGW, Turbo C).
-The program uses rand() for dice generation.

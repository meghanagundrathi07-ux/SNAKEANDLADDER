# SNAKEANDLADDER
This project is a C program implementation of the classic Snake and Ladder game. It is a simple console-based game where players roll a dice, move across a 1–100 board, climb ladders, and avoid snakes. The program uses basic C concepts like loops, functions, arrays, and conditional statements, making it an excellent learning project for beginners.
